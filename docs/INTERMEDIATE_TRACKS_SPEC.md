# Intermediate Tracks (Tier 3) — Canonical Spec

This document is the single source of truth for Intermediate Tracks content, categories, personas, and outcomes. Use it to align copy, UI, and APIs.

---

## 1. Tier Overview

**Intermediate Tracks** represent the learner’s transition from conceptual understanding (Beginner Tier) to applied capability.

This is where learners start:

- applying concepts in deeper exercises,
- completing more structured missions,
- utilizing recipes more intentionally,
- preparing for advanced track missions,
- discovering early specialization preferences.

The Intermediate tier must introduce **real tools, real workflows, real casework**, and begin forming professional competence.

It acts as the **“bridge”** to advanced-level missions and specialization pathways.

| 2 | **Intermediate — Offensive Track** | Practical recon, enumeration, vulnerability discovery, basic exploitation. |
| 3 | **Intermediate — GRC Track** | Risk analysis, policy mapping, maturity assessments, audit workflows. |

## 4. User Goals & Outcomes

### Learner goals

Learners aim to:

- Develop applied, role-specific skills.
- Complete their first real missions requiring multiple steps.
- Build confidence with tools, scripts, or workflows.
- Produce substantial portfolio artifacts.
- Understand where they fit within specialization options.
- Achieve readiness for Tier 4 (Advanced) Tracks.

### System outcomes

- Capture learner performance data.
- Validate user readiness for advanced missions.
- Tailor recipe recommendations.
- Enable specialization branching (optional future feature).

## 5. Display Labels (App)

- In the app UI, **Tier 3** may be shown as **“Advanced Level Track”** or **“Intermediate Level (Tier 3)”** depending on context; the tier overview and category names above are the canonical copy for marketing and in-app intro content.
- Gate: Intermediate Tracks are available only after the learner has completed the Intermediate Level Track (formerly Tier 2) for at least one track.
